It also serves as a testament to the growth of my skills as it took me less than a week to go from design and code implementation to delivery. I am truly proud of this creation and it will serve as a test bench for many future ideas.",

    "description": "During one summer vacation, when I had a lot of free time and was getting into reading, I decided to try my hand at blogging. I also realized that it might be a great way to build my web design skills. Essentially killing two birds with one stone. In building this website I learned a great deal about web hosting, website design, SEO, headless CMSs and static sites. This project holds a special place in my heart as it helped catapult my skills and confidence in my skills to a whole new level.",

    "description": "(In development) Having gone through the struggle of searching for a room to rent as a college student in Jamaica, I understand the issue. So I decided to try building a solution. This is one of the larger projects I have tackled on my own. It's meant to connect landlords in a specific geographical region (Kingston, Jamaica) to student rentors who are looking for decent rooms for their college tenure. I believe there is room for later expansion in terms of scale and use but there are many kinks I have to work out first.",
